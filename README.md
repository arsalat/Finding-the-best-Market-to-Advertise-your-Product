Finding the Two Best Markets to Advertise in an E-learning Product

Let's assume that we're working for an an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. Most of our courses are on web and mobile development, but we also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc. 

We want to promote our product and we'd like to invest some money in advertisement. 

Our goal in this project is to find out the two best markets to advertise our product in. We will be comparing survery data from an existing survey that was conducted for freeCodeCamp, a free e-learning platform.  

The data and the survey can be accesssed here :
